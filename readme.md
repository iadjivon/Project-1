        - 
    - second section: sunsrise
        - bring a chair or a friend. 
    - third section: sunset 
        - bring a beer or a friend. or both! 

    - fourth section: what to bring

- on click, the button takes the user to their selected "destination" 

** Drop-down menu
- They can search by date? country? city? still deciding how to design the drop down menu


** Design a logo
- it says "pick a city, any city"
- on the inside, do a play on the word sunrise and sunset
- Or one logo with sun in the middle, rise at the top and set at the nottom
