// PROJECT 1 - UMBONO
/////////////////////////////////////

 TECHNOLOGIES USED:

- canva - for the logo

  THE APPROACH TAKEN
  - first wireframe what the website looks like
  - HTML code the first design
  - Add CSS to make it look good so that I feel like I'm getting somewhere
  - java script for the functionality 
  
  - redesigned the website multiple times (hardest part was to stick to one design as ideas kept coming)
  - watched youtube videos to help with CSS
  - class video on carousel helped with the carousel I created, along with W3 School website
