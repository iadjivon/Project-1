- MAYBE: add a section where you can drop ask for sunset information by date AND city?


If I have time.... 

    - second section: sunsrise
        - bring a chair or a friend. 
        - fun facts about sunrise and sunset
    - third section: sunset 
        - bring a beer or a friend. or both! 
        - fun facts about sunrise and sunset
    - fourth section: what to bring


JAVASCRIPT  

- Type in city in the search bar
- on click, give the sunset and sunrise information for that city 

If I have time.... 

- Drop-down menu
    - They can search by date? country? city? still deciding how to design the drop down menu


** Design a logo
- it says "pick a city, any city"
- on the inside, do a play on the word sunrise and sunset
- Or one logo with "sun" in the middle, 'rise' at the top and 'set' at the bottom
